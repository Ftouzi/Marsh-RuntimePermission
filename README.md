# Marsh-RuntimePermission
Android sample request runtime permission 

# Introduction
With over 130 unique permissions available to Android developers, itâ€™s hard to know exactly which ones to specify. Android Marshmallow introduces an entirely new spin on application permissions in an attempt to not only simplify permissions, but also to reduce the number of permissions needed.

Android M introduced runtime permissions. Applications targeting M and above need to request their permissions at runtime. This sample introduces the basic use of the runtime permissions API through the support library by verifying permission for Camera.
